The Musical Garment detects sound frequencies and translates them into colors that are shown by the RGB LED lights on a piece of garment. 

The program runs in VPython instead of standard Python. VPython along with its own editor, VIDLE, is available for download at http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html for Windows, at 
http://vpython.org/contents/download_mac.html for Macintosh, and at
 http://vpython.org/contents/download_linux.html for Linux, with guidelines for installation in the downloaded package. Specifically, the version my program runs in is VPython 6.11, and the VIDLE used for it is VIDLE 2.7-6.11. 

Arduino is used to turn on and off the LEDs. Arduino 1.6.6, the version used for my project, is downloadable at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux, with installation guidelines in the downloaded package. The LEDs are all controlled by an Arduino mega 2560 board. 

The LEDs used for my project are Diffused LEDs-RGB 10mm Common Cathode, purchased on spark fun.com.
